# QR_code_generator

This small project was just as a simple task to get me used to working with a frontend and a backend side of a project and merging the two together.

The code picks up on whether you have typed in a https:// URL or not giving the user an error message.

This is how the GUI looks when the code is ran:

If a URL is NOT entered this is the error message:
--There is also an error messsage for no input at all--.

Here is what the GUI looks like after the user has entered a correct one, with the save to file button at the bottom to save to their device:
